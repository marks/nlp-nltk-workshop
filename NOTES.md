- google has been successful because they have had a huge training set from people clicking on the right 'answer'
- what is required?
  1. Domain knowledge
  2. A corpus in the domain
- the NLP pipleline: http://bengfort.com/presentations/discourses-in-language-processing/img/skyview/pipeline.png
  - today, we are ignoring the first two columns
  - morphology: the study of the forms of things, words in particular:
    - orthographic rules: puppy -> puppies
    - morphological rules: goose -> geese or fish
    - parsing task: stemming (lemmatization) and tokenization
      - tokens = symbols of language
      - words = tokens with meaning
      - stem = what you would look up in the dictionary
